A Lamb for the Slaughter

Stephen Morgan

One

He wasn't there when they came in the night. 

He had a commission to finish and stayed in
the shop to put the final coat of French polish on the piano lid. He lost track
of time, he usually did. He carefully rubbed the mahogany to a high shine,
feeling the fatigue in his upper arms with each stroke of the cloth as he
leaned over the wood with a constant pressure. The smell of the polish filled
the shop in a heady, intoxicating wave, adding to Ethan's distraction. He
gradually brought the highlights of the wood into view, a deep, rich curling
grain, shimmering along the top. Every so often he would stop and run his hand
over the wood. It gave him pleasure to feel the smoothness, the sensuous touch
under his hand, like a baby's cheek. 

Ethan
stood back to rest his arms and admire the lid and saw the workshop in its reflection.
The far wall had rows of planes on shelves, clamps lined up along a beam, from
smallest to largest, some wooden and others made from steel. He saw glue pots,
jars of oils and varnish and various woods stickered along the back wall
reaching to the ceiling. Saws of specific uses hung from nails hammered into
the wall beside the racks of chisels. He saw a couple of early photographs of
him and his boys, playing football in the square tacked onto the opposite wall...
and he saw the old wall clock.

At
first glance the time seemed correct, ten past eight and then he turned and
looked at it and realized his mistake. It read twenty minutes before two. Ethan
tightened his lips and let out a sigh, once again he was late for the family
meal. They would be asleep; disappointed that he missed the Sabbath. He hadn't
noticed nightfall. 

He stretched his arms, cracking his knuckles
as he rolled his shoulders to ease the tension in his muscles, then he put away
his tools for the night. He hammered the lids on cans that he opened; put chisels
in the leather roll, oil rags in the water bucket and gave the floor a final
sweep. As he put the broom away and reached for his coat, Ethan's eyes drifted
back to the piano. The full moon's glow stole through the window and rested on
the lid. It was an orange moon, a sick moon as his father, a doctor, always
said. Its pale light seeped through the shop, spilling along the floor like
ribbons. Instead of satisfaction that he usually felt when admiring his day's
work, Ethan was uneasy, unsettled. He drew the blinds over the windows and door
then locked up quickly and stepped in to the street. Pulling his collar up and
tucking in his scarf, he started through the dark streets toward home. 

The moon disappeared behind high, billowing
clouds, its light filtered through the edges giving a soft, muted glow in the
sky. Ethan could make out small gleams of reflection, the moonlight hitting
windows and shinny steel things but nothing along the street was clear. It took
a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dark. 

It was a fifteen-minute walk, past eight city
blocks of brick townhouses and shops with awnings rolled up for the night and
Bach Square where he played football with his boys. A monument dedicated to the
composer stood in the centre of the square with a ring of tall red oak trees
around the perimeter and pathways leading from each corner to the statue. This
section of the city was the old quarter and the streets were paved with cobbles,
set in curved patterns, branching out from each row to the next and blending
into another set of curved stones making concentric patterns along each street
and side alley. Ethan was anxious to get home. It was late and the world they
lived in was not safe anymore.

He was tired, he felt it thoroughly in every
step he took. Distracted by the hour and fatigue, Ethan only noticed the
upheaval when his foot caught a lampshade and kicked it ahead of him. He slowed
to see what it was and saw shapes of other household goods littered around him.

_What is this? Something is wrong!_

As he walked faster he saw shards of broken
glass from the moon's reflection. He kept kicking things. He saw doors torn
from their hinges and household goods strewn down the sidewalks. 

_Oh God, it can't be! They must be here!_

He heard gunfire. He stood dead still and
listened. The sound came from the square. A chill ran down his spine. He pulled
his collar higher and ran down an alley, a shortcut that he knew, and hid
behind a rubbish bin where he could look out on the square. Light flickered on
the bricks above his head. It grew brighter as he heard shouts and screams
echoing down the alley.

_They
are here! Soldiers! Nazis!_

Crouching down further he strained to see
through the gap between the can and the building.

What he
saw took his breath away.

Soldiers
dragged people from their homes. They separated the men from the women and
children and beat them with rifles and clubs, then herded them into trucks with
heavy canvas stretched over the backs. Ethan watched as a woman was wrenched
away from her husband. The soldier reached under her skirt between her legs and
lifted her over his head, laughing before hurling her into a truck that held
only women. The husband was knocked senseless to the ground when he tried to
intervene. They picked him up like rubbish and tossed him into another truck.
Other soldiers piled household treasures; tables, linen, chairs, precious
photos, books, and clothing, onto a fire roaring in the square. Ethan could
feel the heat from the flames. He also felt electricity in the air, a heightened
sense of being alive, pumping adrenaline, and a power of the panic of a mob, a
force so strong that he knew he had to avoid it or be drawn in.

He had
to get home, to find his family; he had to get across the square. 

_But
how?_

If the
soldiers saw him they would beat him as they did the other men. He would
disappear into one of the trucks.

He
tried to see his home, a second and third storey set of rooms with an attic
looking out onto the square. His family had been there three generations. His
father still kept the back study as his bedroom. Ethan couldn't see past the
huge flames that shot to the sky. He had to get higher. 

At the other end of the alley an old metal
fire escape hung from the brick, its bottom rungs hinged up to let people pass
underneath. Ethan crawled away from the can, keeping low, staying to the
shadows, until he was just below the escape. It took a long time. His muscles
were tight and he thought his chest would burst, his heart pounding in his
ears. He couldn't hear the sounds from the square. Lying on his back, Ethan
gauged the bottom rung to be higher then his reach, he would have to jump up to
haul it down. 

_The
sound of the old hinges, the fires light, the sudden movement could expose me
but what else can I do?_

He thought of another time he had used this
fire escape. Before the boys were born, even before he and Rebecca were
married, when they were courting. Ethan hid a bottle of red wine on the roof of
this very building. As he and Rebecca were walking out one evening he steered
her into the alley and stopped below the ladder. She raised her eyebrows, still
smiling but with a question in her eyes. All of a sudden Ethan leapt up and
grabbed the ladder, which swung down easily, and he took her hand.

"I want to show you something."

She laughed "Up there?"

"Yes, up there. I want to show you the world!
Come on!"

They climbed, giggling, to the top,
zig-zagging their way up the many sets of metal stairs until Ethan stepped out
onto the roof and extended his hand to Rebecca. She took it and they found a
chimney to lean against while they looked out over the city. The sun was
setting, casting long shadows across the rooftops and there was a golden glow
to everything. The world seemed magical, like anything was possible. He reached
behind the chimney and brought out two glasses and the wine. Rebecca laughed
with surprise and delight. 

"Before I pour this wine there is a question
that I need answered which will affect the taste of the wine...depending on the
answer."

"How can an answer affect the wine's taste? You are being silly
Ethan."

Ethan put the bottle down and took both
Rebecca's hands in his.

"Will you marry me?"

She was so taken aback that she could only
gasp at first. As he looked into her eyes he thought

"Ethan, I...oh Ethan, of course I will!"

He shook his head to clear the memory.

As he gathered himself to spring, a truck drove past the alley and
then another and another. They were leaving. He had to move. 

Ethan whispered a prayer, and then leapt for
the ladder. One hand slipped off the oily step but his other held. He scrambled
to get a hold with both hands and finally caught a grip. The ladder didn't
budge. It hadn't been used in years and was rusted into place. He hung,
suspended, catching his breath when a soldier walked into the other end of the
alley to relieve himself. Ethan froze. Not a movement, barely a breath as he
watched, wide eyed while the soldier did his business, whistling, looking
around. Ethan braced himself to drop and run but the soldier finished, buttoned
himself and walked out. 

Ethan swung his legs, hooked onto the step and
hauled himself up the ladder in one fast, fluid motion. He moved quickly, up,
up to the top and hoisted himself onto the roof. The wind blew stronger on the
building top. Smoke from the fire curled over the edge of the roof and blew
straight into his face. Crawling on all fours to the edge, he looked down at
the square below.

Except
for the fire burning, it was empty. All the trucks were gone. All the soldiers
but a few who kept watch over the flames were gone. All the people pulled from
their homes were gone. All the shouts and screams were gone. He stared,
dumbfounded, as the autumn leaves of an old oak caught fire and crackled to the
sky. 

_Move!
Now!_

His mind screamed for his legs to move. 

Ethan kept low and hurried across the rooftops.
He could jump from one fire escape to next, climb back up and move on. It took
some time getting across the four rooftops but he finally landed on his
building and ran to the hatch door. Pulling it open, he dropped down inside. 

The attic looked the same, nothing touched. All was as he and his
father had set it up. His eyes scanned the room. 

After their neighbours, the Hienzmens disappeared; Ethan and his father had made the attic into a hideaway. They built cupboards into the eaves and stored drygoods, cans, flour, foodstuffs, books and clothing were hidden. A table set with enough chairs to sit the family and makeshift beds and lights were prepared. Ethan built a wardrobe with a hidden door in the back to hide the entrance to the stairs leading to the attic. If the wardrobe was moved the stairs were covered with a sliding panel that matched the others in the room. 

He called softly. "Rebecca? Papa?"

He moved through the room checking the doors
into the eaves to see if they were there.

"Herzle? Eliezer?" 

Nothing.

He leaned against a doorframe. (It was the
first time he could stop and think.) An overwhelming sense of dread seized him,
the realization of what might have happened. Ethan walked down the staircase
and slid open the panel. The wardrobe was gone. In the dark and he stumbled
through the wall catching his foot on something that lay on the floor, tripping
him onto the smashed, overturned wardrobe. He rolled and staggered to his feet
reaching out to the wall sconce to switch on the light. It was also ripped from
the wall. The tree outside the window still blazed and threw a faint,
flickering light down the hall from the window illuminating the wreckage that
spread out before him. He had to check every room but he knew. He knew they weren't
there. Walking with care, testing every step, he went from room to room calling
their names, listening.

Nothing.

_Why hadn't they gone to the attic? Why didn't Father
lead them to the attic? _

He moved things, looked under things, prayed he would find them, and hoped they weren't in the back of those trucks. He stepped on something and bent to pick it up, it was the black rook. Ethan had carved the chess set as a gift for his parents on their 40th wedding anniversary. His father always carried it with him, tucked into the watch pocket of his vest and displayed it proudly at the slightest encouragement; he never let it out of his possession. 

_Papa
must have known...he is warning me! The Nazis have them!_

Ethan
dropped the rook into his pocket. 

Ethan finally picked up a dining chair and collapsed into it, leaning forward, his head in his hands. He sat for a long time until a noise startled him, brought him back around, a low, primal sob that he realized was his own.
